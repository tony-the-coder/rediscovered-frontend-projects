# Rediscovered Frontend Projects

This repository contains a collection of my early front-end development projects, rediscovered from my Codepen archives. These projects represent my initial explorations in web development, showcasing foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

While these projects were created several years ago and may not reflect my current skills or coding practices, they hold sentimental value as a reminder of my development journey. I had always planned to revisit and update these projects, but other commitments and priorities kept me from doing so.

Now, with renewed focus and a commitment to continuous learning, I intend to revisit these projects and bring them up to date with modern techniques, improved accessibility, and enhanced functionality.

This repository serves as a testament to my growth as a developer and my dedication to ongoing improvement.
